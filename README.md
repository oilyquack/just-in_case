A user starts with 3 cases:

- camelCase
- kebab-case
- snake_case

Every time the user gets an additional 10 points, a new kind of case gets added. In order, these are:

- PascalCase
- 1337
- flatcase
- UPPERCASE
- MACRO_CASE
- COBOL-CASE

The purpose of the game is to get a high winning streak, so there are no continues after a wrong answer.
